# lego-first-vcs
Framework to simplify version control on a Scratch EV3 Classroom project for Lego FIRST.

* Each challenge will be saved into a seperate project with each project being a seperate repository.  This is to mitigate merge conflicts.
* Trunk-only is the easiest model to understand so there is no support for branching.
